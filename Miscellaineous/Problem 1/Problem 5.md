Bowling is a sport in which a player rolls a bowling ball towards a group ofpins, the target being to knock down the pins at the end of a lane. In this challenge,the rules of the game are slightly modiÔ¨Åed. There are N number of pins, N is even,and the pins are arranged in a horizontal line instead of a triangular formation. Theith pin has the number arr[i] on it. In each throw, you have to knock down exactly
two consecutive pins. Once you knock down pins at positions i and i+1, those at i-1and i+2 will become adjacent. And you'll getarr[i-1]*arr[i]*arr[i+1]*arr[i+2] points for knocking the ith and i+1th pins down. Ifi-1 or i+2 goes out of bounds, assume that there is a pin with the number 1 at thatposition. Find out the maximum number of points one can get when played wisely.Since the answer can be large, return the answer modulo 1e9 + 7 as output
