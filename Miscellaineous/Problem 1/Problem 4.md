Given a binary string of 0s and 1s, you can perform the followingoperation a ﬁnite number (possibly zero) of times: Choose a substring of lengthgreater than or equal to K and ﬂip all the bits of the substring. You have to ﬁnd themaximum possible value of K such that after performing this operation a ﬁnitenumber (possibly zero) of times, you can make all the bits of the string equal.
